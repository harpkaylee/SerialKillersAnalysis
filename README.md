**US Serial Killers Data Visualizations**
Welcome to the US Serial Killers Data Visualizations project!

**Overview**
This repository hosts a collection of visualizations derived from scraped data on serial killers in the United States. These visualizations offer insights into the most notorious individuals, their activity periods, and the geographical distribution of their victims.

**Visualizations**
Multiple visualizations were created to show different aspects of the data collected to try and give a representative view of the data. The visualizations were narrowed down to the top 15, based on proven victims, to make the information more readable.

**About**
This project is maintained by Kaylee Harp. It was created with the aim of shedding light on the chilling reality of serial killers in the United States and fostering a deeper understanding of crime patterns.
